#The Site

Programming Everything is about finding and collecting the best resources for tutorials, talks, and tomes for all different kinds of programming languages. Really it's just a compendium of all my favorite things from when I was learning all these languages.

#The Languages

In no particular order I plan on gathering material on these languages/technologies:

- Python
- Java
- JavaScript / Node.js
- Web Development (HTML/CSS)
- C/C++
- Haskell
- Go
- Clojure
- Scala
- Rust
- Ruby

If you looked at "Web Development" and thought, "Gee, that's incredibly vague," then you hit the nail on the head. I did that intentionally because the webdev hole goes especially deep, and I'm not exactly sure how one divides that up yet.

#What's a *Timeless Debate*?

People have argued senselessly over purely opinionated perspectives for, well, ever. Questions like *Is it pronounced gif or gif?* or *Where does upstate New York begin?* are classic examples. I call them the *Timeless Debates* (or *TDs*.) There isn't a singular "right" answer, although everyone thinks there is.

If you're new to the world of programming, we have a lot of *TDs*, the most controversial being the *vim vs. emacs* debate (vim 4 lyfe). As you're learning and meet more people, you'll gradually absorb their opinions and styles. Inevitably, even you will fall on one side of a *TD*. I try to catalogue the *Timeless Debates* in programming as best I can, and I may display a warning near content that gets kind of *TD*-y.
